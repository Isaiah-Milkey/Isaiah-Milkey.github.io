# Starting this Site!

Hey everyone! I’m Isaiah.

This is more of a beginning post, so if you want to learn more about me, check the ‘Author’ page!

I’ve been thinking about making a website for a long time now.  (It kind of comes with the major).

For a long time I had nothing to put out, so I never really fully invested until now. This summer (2025) I’m officially joining the Rolston Lab group at ASU!
They’ve been an awesome group and I feel so lucky to be a part of the team.

Here, I want to post what I’ve learned, as well as what I’ve made. It gives me an outlet to write, learn, and share my knowledge with others. 

As for how this site was created, it is based off a template from Enscribe, which I will link here:

It’s been great and easy to use, and I heavily recommend you take a look at the GitHub, at least if you’re interested in seeing other cool sites as well.

Thanks for taking a look around, and hope you learn some cool stuff like I have.
